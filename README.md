## Description

This application is a simple text editor, an example of a PWA (Progressive Web Application). PWA's blend the benefits of a traiditonal browser experience with those of a mobile app, including the ability to run offline. They ensure apps work without an internet connection by using Service Worker and Cache API's as well as browser based database API's that can be queried with limited or no connectivity. It uses a number of data persistence techniques in case one option is not supported by a particular browser. In short, PWA's are a useful tool that can be used just about anywhere and on any device with browser access.
